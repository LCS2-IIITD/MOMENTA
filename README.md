## Instructions
The .py contains the exhaustive set of steps required to be run in sequence.
For data-set loading:<br>
_Pl Note: For demo purposes, only 50 total data samples are linked as part of this repo._
1. It contains code for loading pre-saved ROI and entity features, which can be loaded if available.
2. Otherwise the code for extracting features on-demand is also included.

For initializing dataset and data loader for pytorch

1. Load the data-set for training and testing as per the requirement of the run.

Experimental setting<br>
Configurations for the binary/multi-class setting (training/testing/evaluation) has to be considered as per the requirement, code blocks for which are provided and suitably commented out.
